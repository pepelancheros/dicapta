          By developing accessible communications for everyone regardless of
          their abilities, Dicapta focuses on ensuring that media,
          entertainment, and culture are widely available and accessible for
          people with sensory disabilities, and Latinos in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2005, we at Dicapta have been proudly honored with grants from
          the United States Department of Education and the United States
          Department of Health and Human Services.

        <p>
          Considering that in 2020 Latinos were the 19% of the U.S. population
          and that the incidence of disabilities in this community is increasing
          faster than in other races, we at Dicapta concentrate our efforts on
          serving the specific needs of Latinos with disabilities.

          Since its creation and continuously, Dicapta has focused its efforts
          on developing technological tools that allow the creation of
          accessibility elements more effectively and efficiently to guarantee
          access to education, culture, and information for people with sensory
          disabilities.

          For us, accessibility is how usable a product, service, media piece,
          educational tool, website, and cultural or entertainment activity is
          by people with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accessibility is a meaningful word that invites us to think about
          inclusion and equality.
